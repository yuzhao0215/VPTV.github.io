# MP1 Synchronization of Cameras

Synchronization of multiple cameras is the base requirement of VPTV. 
The synchronization is achieved by camera software development kit (SDK) 
from our cameras’ manufacture “Optitrack”. Therefore, the first mini project 
is to master Optitrack camera SDK. This SDK provides functions to control cameras 
in terms of synchronization, camera frame rate, exposure, and image segmentation methods.
 A test using stopwatch will be built to test if eight cameras capture images at the
 same instant. If synchronized correctly, all images will show the same time stamp.

## Code Finished
I have implemented the code for synchronization of eight cameras.
The code can be found [here](https://github.com/yuzhao0215/VPTV_tutorial/test).

## TODO
1. Please read the code and compile it on your local desktop. 
2. Modify the code to capture a set of pictures of an object that can show the cameras are synchronized.
3. Explain what your code do by commenting along with the code.
